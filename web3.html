                <p class="Columns"> Sisters Powder and Vi find their parents dead among the bodies and the rubble of a battle on a bridge. They are taken in by Vander, the leader of the failed
                    rebellion, as his own children. Years later, Vi and Powder rob a Piltover penthouse with their adopted brothers, Mylo and Claggor. Powder steals a set of magical
                    crystals and accidentally shatters one. This causes an explosion that destroys a large portion of the building. Returning to the undercity, the siblings encounter
                    Deckard and his thugs; while they beat them in a fistfight, Powder is chased and loses the loot. Vander, now a community leader in Zaun, scolds the children for their
                    carelessness, and attempts to smooth things over with Grayson, the Sheriff of the enforcers, and her subordinate Marcus. Vi berates Mylo for calling Powder a "jinx" and
                    reassures her sister that things will get better. In the lowest parts of the undercity, crime lord Silco extracts information from Deckard and tests a new mutagen known as
                    Shimmer on a rat.

                <h2 class="EpisodeHead">Episode 2 - "Some Mysteries Are Better Left Unsolved"</h2>
                <p class="Columns"> The crystals that Powder stole turn out to belong to Jayce Talis, a student at Piltover's academy. Piltover's ruling council has him testify about using illegal equipment in
                    unsanctioned experiments. Jayce was saved by arcane magic as a child and believes it can be a new resource for Piltover's evolution. The academy expels him when he admits the
                    magical nature of the experiments, and his research is ordered to be destroyed. On the verge of suicide, his beliefs are renewed when Viktor, the disabled assistant of the academy's
                    professor Heimerdinger, offers to help him. In Zaun, Marcus pressures Vander to reveal the true culprits of the robbery, while Zaunites pressure him to fight back against the interference
                    of the enforcers. He chooses to keep his family safe and remain neutral, leaving some unsure of his leadership. Vi decides to turn herself in. Meanwhile, Silco manipulates Deckard into swallowing
                    a vial of Shimmer.

                <p class="Columns"> Vander stops Vi from turning herself in. Silco then captures him after Deckard, now heavily mutated, kills Grayson and her men, sparing only Marcus. Vi, Mylo, and Claggor go to rescue Vander, leaving Powder alone.
                    In Piltover, Jayce and Viktor secretly work with the crystals under the discretion of councilor Mel Medarda and invent Hextech, a new arcane technology. It is revealed that Vander betrayed
                    Silco in the past, and tried to drown him. In the undercity, the siblings reach Vander but are cut off by Silco. Vi fights off Silco's thugs, but is badly beaten by Deckard. Powder, attempting to save her,
                    causes an explosion that kills Claggor and Mylo. Vander, wounded by Silco, takes Shimmer, kills Deckard and saves Vi before dying. In her grief, Vi hits Powder, calls her a "jinx" and walks away. Seeing Silco approach,
                    Vi attempts to return to Powder but is ambushed and captured by Marcus. Believing Vi abandoned her, Powder breaks down in Silco's arms. He embraces Powder and tells her that "We'll show them all."

                <h2 class="EpisodeHead">Episode 4 - "Happy Progress Day!"</h2>
                <p class="Columns"> Several years later, Piltover prospers with Jayce's Hextech technology and celebrates its 200th anniversary on a holiday called 'Progress Day'. Jayce initially hopes to reveal his and Viktor's latest gemstone device at the ceremony,
                    but decides not to after Heimerdinger warns him on its potential dangers. Elsewhere, Powder, now a teenager going by the name of Jinx, works for Silco, who she views as a surrogate father. She helps him smuggle materials,
                    mainly Shimmer, into Piltover. A job goes awry when the Firelights, an undercity gang, interfere. While fighting, Jinx briefly mistakes a Firefly as Vi and has a violent breakdown. Caitlyn, an enforcer and Jayce's childhood friend,
                    investigates what happened. Attempting to repair her damaged reputation with Silco, Jinx steals Jayce's gemstone and sets off an explosion that kills six enforcers. Jayce is given a Piltover council seat to protect their people
                    from the stolen gemstone. Looking for information, Caitlyn travels to Stillwater prison and encounters an adult Vi, having been imprisoned there by Marcus.

                <h2 class="EpisodeHead">Episode 5 - "Everybody Wants to Be My Enemy"</h2>
                <p class="Columns"> Caitlyn releases Vi from prison because of her knowledge of the undercity, and works with her to find Silco. Vi tracks down Silco's second-in-command, Sevika, who reveals Jinx's relationship with Silco, a shock which gives Sevika
                    the opportunity to stab her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Marcus was promoted to Sheriff with Silco's help. In exchange, Marcus allows Shimmer to be smuggled, and blames the Progress Day bombing and robbery on the Firelights.
                    Jinx refuses to work on the new Hextech gemstones because of the trauma of killing her family with a similar device. In response, Silco takes her to the river where Vander tried to drown him and tries to convince Powder to accept her
                    new identity as Jinx via a baptism. Back in Piltover, councillor Medarda starts a romantic relationship with Jayce, while also helping him to navigate the complex political sphere he now finds himself in as a councillor. Meanwhile, Viktor's
                    illness worsens and he grows increasingly desperate to find a cure through Hextech technology.

                <p class="Columns"> After Viktor collapses in the lab from his illness, he and Jayce begin to study the "Hexcore", a new Hextech machine that reacts to organic matter and has the potential to cure it. Heimerdinger tries to have it destroyed due to
                    its danger, prompting Jayce to orchestrate his removal from the council. Viktor approaches Singed, his childhood mentor, to help perfect the Hexcore. Singed intuits Viktor's dire state of health, and provides him with a variant of
                    Shimmer to help him. Silco, now aware of Vi's reappearance, orders Marcus to kill her and Caitlyn before they can resurface in Piltover, and blockades the bridge in order to intercept them. Jinx interrogates Sevika and also
                    learns of Vi's return. Vi and Caitlyn find a safehouse in the lowest slums of Zaun so Vi can recover from her fight with Sevika, but Silco finds them after bribing the local addicts with Shimmer. After escaping, the pair notice the blue smoke
                    from a flare that Vi gave Jinx before their ill-fated mission to rescue Vander years ago, and the sisters reunite. However, Caitlyn's presence triggers Jinx's mistrust. The Firelights intervene, steal the gemstone, and kidnap Caitlyn and Vi.

                <p class="Columns"> Marcus' blockades increase unrest between the two cities. The leader of the Firelights is revealed to be Ekko, now a gruff and battle-hardened warrior. He explains that Silco took over the underground after Vander's death and made the
                    populace dependent on Shimmer. Under Ekko, the Firelights have been leading efforts to thwart Silco and rehabilitate addicts. Meanwhile, Viktor uses Shimmer to enable the Hexcore to modify his failing body. Seeking to return the gemstone
                    to Piltover, Ekko and Caitlyn head to Piltover, while Vi parts ways with them to find and reason with Jinx. Ekko and Caitlyn are stopped at the blockade by Marcus, who shoots Ekko and prepares to kill Caitlyn. Seeing this, Vi runs
                    back to help her. Envious of Caitlyn, Jinx detonates a swarm of robotic insects on the bridge, killing Marcus and his enforcers. Ekko and Jinx face off as Vi and an injured Caitlyn flee to Piltover. Ekko bests her in a fight but hesitates
                    to deliver the final blow, allowing Jinx to detonate a grenade near them.

                <p class="Columns"> Silco finds the heavily injured Jinx in the aftermath of the explosion and sees that she managed to steal back the gemstone. He takes her to Singed to heal her wounds. As Jinx endures Singed's treatment, she hallucinates that it is Vi and Caitlyn
                    inflicting the pain. He injects her with Shimmer, turning her eyes violet. Meanwhile, Mel's mother arrives in Piltover following the assassination of Mel's brother and attempts to prepare her for the brewing war with Zaun. While trying to
                    help the locals of Zaun, Heimerdinger encounters Ekko, who injured his leg escaping from Jinx's grenade. Meanwhile, Viktor succeeds in healing his body through the Hexcore and is able to run for the first time. However, further experimentation
                    results in the death of his childhood friend and assistant Sky. After failing to convince the council to intervene against Silco, Vi abandons Caitlyn and partners with Jayce to take down Silco's Shimmer factories. Armed with Hextech weaponry,
